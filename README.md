## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Bash (any modern version)
- Git installed and configured

### Install with install.sh (recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/worktree-manager.git
cd worktree-manager

# Run the installer
bash install.sh

# Verify installation
wtm help
```

The installer copies `wtm` to `~/.local/bin` (or `/usr/local/bin` if writable) and ensures it's executable.

### Install from npm

```bash
# Install globally with your preferred package manager
npm install -g @jx0/wtm

# or
pnpm add -g @jx0/wtm

# or
yarn global add @jx0/wtm

# Verify installation
wtm help
```

### Manual / Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/worktree-manager.git
cd worktree-manager

# Run directly
./wtm help

# Or link into your PATH for local use
ln -s "$(pwd)/wtm" /usr/local/bin/wtm
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone a repository into a wtm-managed bare structure
wtm init git@github.com:user/myrepo.git

# Or adopt an existing repo you've already cloned
cd ~/projects/existing-repo
wtm init

# Either way, you end up with:
#   myrepo/
#   ├── .git/           <- bare Git internals
#   └── main/           <- worktree with your code

# Start working in the worktree
cd myrepo/main

# Create a new feature worktree
wtm create feature-auth --from main

# Work on your feature in the new shell...
# (edit files, make commits, etc.)

# Exit the shell when done
exit

# Back in the bare repository, list all worktrees
wtm list

# Clean up merged worktrees
wtm cleanup
```

## 📖 Command Reference

### `wtm init <url> [path]` — Clone

Clones a repository into a wtm-managed bare repository structure.

```bash
# Clone using repo name as directory
wtm init git@github.com:user/myrepo.git

# Clone with custom directory name
wtm init git@gitlab.com:org/platform.git myproject
```

**What it does:**

1. Extracts repository name from URL (or uses provided path)
2. Creates directory with `.git/` subdirectory for bare Git data
3. Clones the repository as a bare clone
4. Configures fetch refspec for all branches
5. Detects the default branch (from origin/HEAD, or main/master)
6. Creates an initial worktree for the default branch

**Supported URL formats:**
- `git@github.com:user/repo.git` (SSH)
- `https://github.com/user/repo.git` (HTTPS)
- `ssh://git@gitlab.com/org/repo.git` (SSH with protocol)

### `wtm init [path]` — Adopt

Converts an existing git repository into wtm's bare-repo-with-worktrees structure, in place.

```bash
# Adopt the repo you're currently in
cd ~/projects/myrepo
wtm init

# Or point at a repo by path
wtm init ~/projects/myrepo
```

**What it does:**

1. Validates the repo (clean working tree, has remote, not already bare, no detached HEAD)
2. Moves all files to a temporary directory
3. Converts `.git/` to bare mode
4. Creates a worktree named after your current branch (e.g., on `main` → `myrepo/main/`)
5. Restores gitignored and untracked files into the worktree
6. If anything fails, automatically reverts to the original state

**Preserves:** gitignored files (`.env`, `node_modules`), untracked files, and local unpushed commits.

**Requires:** clean working tree — commit or stash uncommitted changes first.

**Final structure (both clone and adopt):**
```
myrepo/
├── .git/              <- bare Git internals
└── main/              <- worktree (named after your checked-out branch)
```

### `wtm create <name> --from <base_branch>`

Creates a new worktree with a new branch based on the specified base branch, then spawns a new shell in that worktree.

```bash
# Create worktree from main branch
wtm create feature-auth --from main

# Create hotfix from master
wtm create hotfix-123 --from master

# Create feature branch from another branch
wtm create review-pr --from feature-x
```

**What it does:**

1. Validates you're in a bare repository
2. Fetches the latest changes from the base branch
3. Creates a new branch named `<name>`
4. Creates a worktree directory at `./<name>`
5. Executes the `.wtm/post_create` hook if present in the new worktree
6. Spawns a new shell session in the worktree directory

**Important:** This command starts a new shell in the worktree. When you're done working, use `exit` to return to your original shell in the bare repository.

### `wtm checkout <name>`

Creates a worktree from an existing remote branch if it doesn't already exist locally.

```bash
# Create worktree from existing remote branch
wtm checkout existing-remote-branch
```

**Behavior:**

- If worktree already exists: displays a success message (but does NOT change your shell's directory)
- If worktree doesn't exist but remote branch exists: creates worktree from the remote branch
- If neither exists: shows available worktrees and creation instructions

**Important Note:** Due to how shells work, this command cannot change your current shell's directory. To work in a worktree:

- Use `wtm create` which spawns a new shell in the worktree, OR
- Manually `cd` into the worktree directory after creation

This command is primarily useful for creating worktrees from existing remote branches without specifying a base branch.

### `wtm list`

Displays all worktrees in a formatted table.

```bash
wtm list
```

**Output:**

```
Worktrees:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
feature-auth                   [feature-auth]       a1b2c3d4e
main-work                      [main]              f5g6h7i8j
(bare)                         (bare)              k9l0m1n2o
```

### `wtm delete <name> [--force]`

Removes a worktree and its associated files.

```bash
# Safe deletion (with confirmation if needed)
wtm delete feature-auth

# Force deletion (skips safety checks)
wtm delete old-feature --force
```

**Safety features:**

- Cannot delete bare repository
- Validates worktree exists before deletion
- Force flag available for stuck worktrees

### `wtm cleanup [options]`

Interactively find and delete worktrees whose branches have been merged upstream.

```bash
# Interactive mode - select which merged worktrees to delete
wtm cleanup

# Specify base branch for merge detection
wtm cleanup --base main

# Preview what would be deleted without actually deleting
wtm cleanup --dry-run

# Delete all merged worktrees without prompting
wtm cleanup --yes
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--base <branch>` | Base branch for merge detection (auto-detected from origin/HEAD by default) |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be deleted without deleting |
| `--yes` | Delete all merged worktrees without interactive prompts |

**A worktree is considered safe to delete when ALL of these are true:**

1. **Merged upstream** - Branch commit is an ancestor of the base branch, OR the remote branch has been deleted (typically after a merge request is merged)
2. **No uncommitted changes** - Working tree has no unstaged, staged, or untracked files
3. **No unpushed commits** - No local commits that aren't reachable from the base branch

**Protected branches** (never suggested for cleanup):
- `main`, `master`, `next`, `prerelease`

**Example workflow:**

```bash
$ wtm cleanup
Using base branch: main
Fetching latest from origin/main...
Scanning worktrees for cleanup candidates...

Found 2 worktree(s) safe to clean up:
  - feature-auth [feature-auth]
  - bugfix-123 [bugfix-123]

? Select worktrees to delete:
  [x] feature-auth [feature-auth]
  [ ] bugfix-123 [bugfix-123]

? Delete 1 worktree(s)? Yes

Deleted worktree 'feature-auth' at /path/to/feature-auth
Pruned stale worktree references.

Cleanup complete. Deleted 1 worktree(s).
```

### `wtm help`

Shows comprehensive help information including examples and features.

## 🪝 Hook System

Worktree Manager runs hook scripts at lifecycle events. Hooks live **inside the worktree** under `.wtm/`, so they can be committed to git and shared with the rest of the team — or `.gitignore`d for personal-only setup. Hooks are run with `bash`; the executable bit is not required.

### Discovery

For each hook, wtm looks at exactly one location:

```
<worktree>/.wtm/<hook-name>
```

If the file exists, it runs. If not, the hook is a silent no-op. Because hooks are checked out with the rest of the branch's tree, the hook that runs for a new worktree is the version committed on its base branch.

### Available Hooks

#### `post_create`

Runs immediately after a worktree is created (via `wtm create` or `wtm checkout`), with the working directory set to the new worktree.

**Environment Variables:**

- `$WORKTREE_DIR` — Absolute path to the new worktree
- `$WORKTREE_NAME` — Name of the worktree
- `$BASE_BRANCH` — Branch the worktree was created from
- `$BARE_REPO_PATH` — Path to the bare repository

**Example `.wtm/post_create`:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Committed at .wtm/post_create on your base branch

echo "🪝 Setting up new worktree: $WORKTREE_NAME"

# Install dependencies if package.json exists
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "📦 Installing dependencies..."
    pnpm install --silent
fi

# Copy environment files from bare repo
if [ -f "$BARE_REPO_PATH/.env.example" ]; then
    echo "📄 Copying .env.example to .env"
    cp "$BARE_REPO_PATH/.env.example" ".env"
fi

echo "✅ Worktree setup complete!"
```

**Setup (shared, team hook):**

```bash
# In a worktree on the branch you want to share the hook from (e.g. main)
mkdir -p .wtm
$EDITOR .wtm/post_create
git add .wtm/post_create
git commit -m "chore: add wtm post_create hook"
git push

# Test by creating a new worktree from that branch
wtm create test-feature --from main
```

**Setup (personal, untracked hook):**

If you want a hook that only runs on your machine, add `.wtm/post_create` to `.git/info/exclude` (which is per-clone and not committed) before creating the file. wtm will still discover and run it — git just won't track it. Avoid putting `.wtm/` in the repo's `.gitignore`: that would block teammates from sharing hooks via the same path.

### Security

Because `.wtm/post_create` is committed to git, anyone with merge access to a branch you check out can run arbitrary code on your machine the moment you `wtm create` or `wtm checkout` from it. This is the same trust model as `npm install` post-install scripts and any other build scripts in the repo. Treat hook changes with the same care as any other code review.

### Migrating from earlier versions

Earlier versions of wtm looked for hooks at the **bare repository root** (e.g. `<bareRoot>/post_create`). That location is no longer consulted. To migrate:

1. Move your existing hook to `.wtm/post_create` on the branch(es) you want it to run on (commonly your default branch, so new worktrees inherit it).
2. Commit and push.
3. Delete the old `<bareRoot>/post_create` file — it is now ignored by wtm and serves no purpose.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
worktree-manager/
├── wtm                  # Single Bash script — all commands included
├── package.json         # NPM metadata (for global installs)
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

**Why a single Bash script?**

`wtm` is intentionally a thin wrapper around Git's native `worktree` commands. Rather than pulling in a runtime like Bun or Node, everything is implemented in portable Bash — making it trivial to install, inspect, and modify.

**Key functions inside `wtm`:**

- `wtm_cmd_init` — Clone or adopt repositories
- `wtm_cmd_create` — Create worktrees from a base branch
- `wtm_cmd_checkout` — Create worktrees from existing remote branches
- `wtm_cmd_list` — Parse `git worktree list --porcelain` into a table
- `wtm_cmd_delete` — Remove worktrees safely
- `wtm_cmd_cleanup` — Detect merged branches with interactive selection
- `wtm_run_hook` — Execute `.wtm/post_create` hooks with environment variables

## 🔧 Configuration

Worktree Manager works out of the box with standard bare repositories. No configuration files needed.

**Repository Requirements:**

```bash
# Must be a bare repository
git config core.bare true

# Should have remote configured
git remote -v
# origin  git@github.com:user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  git@github.com:user/repo.git (push)
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Development Server Workflows

Perfect for shared development servers where multiple developers work on different features:

```bash
# Developer 1
wtm create user-authentication --from main

# Developer 2
wtm create payment-integration --from main

# Code review
wtm create review-pr-123 --from feature-branch
```

### CI/CD Environments

For automated build systems, you can use git worktree commands directly and use wtm for cleanup:

```bash
# Build script
git worktree add -b build-$BUILD_ID build-$BUILD_ID origin/$BRANCH_NAME
cd build-$BUILD_ID
# ... run build process ...
cd ..
wtm delete build-$BUILD_ID --force
```

**Note:** `wtm create` spawns an interactive shell, so it's not suitable for automated scripts. Use git's native `worktree add` command for CI/CD, and `wtm delete` for cleanup.

### Feature Development

Streamline your feature development workflow:

```bash
# Start new feature (spawns new shell in worktree)
wtm create feature-dashboard --from main

# Work on feature in the new shell...
# (commits, testing, etc.)

# Exit when done
exit

# Back in bare repo, work on another feature if needed
wtm create hotfix-urgent --from main

# Work on hotfix...
exit

# Clean up when done
wtm delete feature-dashboard
wtm delete hotfix-urgent
```

### Periodic Cleanup

Keep your bare repository tidy by periodically cleaning up merged worktrees:

```bash
# See what can be cleaned up
wtm cleanup --dry-run

# Interactively select and delete merged worktrees
wtm cleanup

# Or automatically clean up all merged worktrees (useful in scripts)
wtm cleanup --yes
```

This is especially useful when working with merge request workflows - after your MRs are merged and the remote branches are deleted, `wtm cleanup` will detect these and offer to remove the local worktrees.

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-username/worktree-manager.git
cd worktree-manager

# Test your changes locally
./wtm help
./wtm list
```

Since `wtm` is a single Bash script, changes are immediate — no build step required. Just edit `wtm` and run.

### Project Structure

- All logic lives in the single `wtm` script
- Keep commands as thin wrappers around `git worktree` when possible
- Follow existing Bash patterns (portable syntax, no Bashisms beyond `[[ ]]`)
